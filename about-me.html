          <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>
          <p>
            I used to be a pack rat. I had so many things that I thought that I
            loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it
            because there was too much. Things were terrible. I had a job that I
            hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a
            relationship.
          </p>
          <h2>How I turned things around</h2>
          <p>
            I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. I
            literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place
            and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job. It wasn't
            easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I
            didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
          </p>
          <h2>Now I live the simple life</h2>
          <p>
            Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm
            less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time
            to enjoy. With how much it turned my life around, I felt like I had
            no choice but to start sharing how I did it, and how others can
            benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started
            this site!
